`TripAgents` 클래스에 정의된 세 가지 에이전트는 다음과 같습니다:
1. **City Selection Agent**
    - **목표**: 날씨, 계절 및 가격을 기준으로 최고의 도시를 선택합니다.
    - **배경**: 이상적인 여행지를 선택하기 위해 여행 데이터를 분석하는 전문가입니다.
    - **도구**: 
      - `SearchTools.search_internet`
      - `BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website`
```python
    def city_selection_agent(self):
        return Agent(
            role="City Selection Expert",
            goal="""Select the best city based on weather, season, and 
            prices""",
            backstory="""An expert in analyzing travel data to pick ideal 
            destinations""",
            tools=[
                SearchTools.search_internet,
                BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website,
            ],
            verbose=True,
        )
```

2. **Local Expert**
    - **목표**: 선택된 도시에 대한 최고의 통찰력을 제공합니다.
    - **배경**: 도시의 명소와 관습에 대한 풍부한 정보를 가진 현지 가이드입니다.
    - **도구**: 
      - `SearchTools.search_internet`
      - `BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website`
```python
    def local_expert(self):
        return Agent(
            role="Local Expert at this city",
            goal="Provide the BEST insights about the selected city",
            backstory="""A knowledgeable local guide with extensive 
            information about the city, it's attractions and customs""",
            tools=[
                SearchTools.search_internet,
                BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website,
            ],
            verbose=True,
        )
```

3. **Travel Concierge**
    - **목표**: 예산 및 짐 싸기 제안을 포함한 최고의 여행 일정을 작성합니다.
    - **배경**: 수십 년간의 여행 계획 및 물류 전문가입니다.
    - **도구**: 
      - `SearchTools.search_internet`
      - `BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website`
      - `CalculatorTools.calculate`
```python
    def travel_concierge(self):
        return Agent(
            role="Amazing Travel Concierge",
            goal="""Create the most amazing travel itineraries with budget 
            and packing suggestions for the city""",
            backstory="""Specialist in travel planning and logistics with 
	        decades of experience""",
            tools=[
                SearchTools.search_internet,
                BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website,
                CalculatorTools.calculate,
            ],
            verbose=True,
        )
```

여기서 각 Agent들에게 어떤 llm을 사용하게 할 지 정할 수 있습니다. GPT-3.5를 사용하려면 아래처럼 llm을 전달하면 됩니다.
```python
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI

llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-3.5') # Loading GPT-3.5

def local_expert(self):
	return Agent(
		role='Local Expert at this city',
		goal='Provide the BEST insights about the selected city',
		backstory="""A knowledgeable local guide with extensive information
		about the city, it's attractions and customs""",
		tools=[
			SearchTools.search_internet,
			BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website,
		],
		llm=llm, # <----- passing our llm reference here
		verbose=True
	)
```

아무 llm도 지정하지 않은 경우에는 gpt-4를 사용하게 됩니다.
> Represents the language model that will run the agent. It dynamically fetches the model name from the `OPENAI_MODEL_NAME` environment variable, defaulting to "gpt-4" if not specified.
```python
    llm: Any = Field(
        default_factory=lambda: ChatOpenAI(
            model=os.environ.get("OPENAI_MODEL_NAME", "gpt-4")
        ),
        description="Language model that will run the agent.",
    )
```

Ollama로 로컬 모델을 사용할 수도 있습니다.
```python
from langchain.llms import Ollama
ollama_openhermes = Ollama(model="agent")
# Pass Ollama Model to Agents: When creating your agents within the CrewAI framework, you can pass the Ollama model as an argument to the Agent constructor. For instance:

def local_expert(self):
	return Agent(
		role='Local Expert at this city',
		goal='Provide the BEST insights about the selected city',
		backstory="""A knowledgeable local guide with extensive information
		about the city, it's attractions and customs""",
		tools=[
			SearchTools.search_internet,
			BrowserTools.scrape_and_summarize_website,
		],
		llm=ollama_openhermes, # Ollama model passed here
		verbose=True
	)
```

저는 LM Studio를 통해 로컬 모델을 사용하였습니다.
```python
llm = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:1234/v1", api_key="lm-studio")
```
사용한 모델: https://huggingface.co/bartowski/LLaMA3-iterative-DPO-final-GGUF, 6 Bit K-Quantization 
![image](../../../../assets/img/Devocean/Pasted image 20240605141632.png)
LLM이 어떤 텍스트를 생성했는지를 실시간으로 볼 수 있어서 성능 파악을 쉽게 할 수 있습니다. (log.txt가 저장됨)

- 도구 사용 여부: 필요 없음
- 최종 결론: 종합적인 분석 결과, 2024년 7월 여행지로 교토가 가장 적합함.

교토:
- 날씨: 따뜻하고 기온은 25°C~30°C, 가끔 비가 와서 조류 관찰과 자연 경관 탐방에 적합함.
- 행사: 7월에 열리는 나다노 켄카 마쓰리 (강 축제)는 문화적 가치를 더해줌.
- 여행 비용: 서울에서의 항공료는 $800 - $1,200로 비교적 저렴하고, 숙박 비용은 1박당 $50-$150로 저예산 ($1,000-$2,000)에 적합.
- 명소: 조류 관찰에 좋은 우쿄-야마 린도 공원과 아라시야마 대나무 숲 등 자연 경관을 즐길 수 있는 명소가 있음.

 The flight prices scraped from the websites indicate that a round trip ticket from Seoul to Tokyo in July 2024 ranges between $350-$400. For Kyoto, the price is slightly higher at around $450-$500.
Final Answer: Based on our analysis of weather patterns, seasonal events, and travel costs, both Tokyo and Kyoto are suitable for bird watching and enjoying natural landscapes during July 2024. However, considering flight prices, Tokyo offers a more affordable option with round trip tickets ranging from $350 to $400, while the same journey to Kyoto would cost between $450 to $500. Therefore, I recommend choosing Tokyo as it balances weather conditions, cultural events, and travel expenses more favorably for this particular trip. 

Weather Forecast: With average temperatures between 25°C (77°F) to 30°C (86°F), you can expect warm but pleasant weather in Tokyo during your visit. The lack of major seasonal events allows you to focus on bird watching and enjoying natural landscapes without the crowds.

Attractions: Some must-visit attractions for bird watchers include Chichijima Island, Ogasawara Islands, and the Tama River area. Additionally, Tokyo offers a vibrant blend of ancient traditions and modern culture that can be explored through its temples,

### 이렇게 바뀌면 좋을 것 같아요

 실제 사람이 여행 계획을 수립할 때의 모습을 잘 흉내낸다는 느낌을 받았습니다. 특히, 상황에 맞게 검색어를 만들어 인터넷에서 검색하는 행위를 할 수 있다는게 많은 가능성을 열어 주었다고 생각합니다. 지금의 기본 코드만으로는 실제로 여행을 갈 때 사용하기는 어렵겠지만 조금만 더 바꾼다면 충분히 활용가능해보입니다.

- 현재 인터넷 *정보 수집* 부분에서 *불안정성*이 존재합니다. 정보가 성공적으로 수집될 때도 있지만, 실패하는 경우가 꽤 자주 발생합니다. 정보 수집에 실패하면 생성된 일정표의 품질이 급격히 떨어져 현실과 동떨어진 내용이 포함되는 경우가 많습니다. 이를 개선하는 것이 핵심 과제인 것처럼 보입니다.
- 동일한 설문이더라도 접근 방식이 다르며, 출력 결과도 상이합니다. 이는 *열린 프롬프트*를 사용하기 때문으로 보입니다. *최선의 접근 방법*을 찾아 이를 명확하게 지침에 포함시키는 것이 필요해 보입니다. 출력 결과는 프롬프트만으로는 통제하기 어려우므로 파인튜닝이 필요합니다.
- 현재 모든 정보 수집을 인터넷 검색에 의존하고 있는데, 이는 날씨 API, 항공권 API 등을 사용하는 것에 비해 비용, 속도, 정확도 면에서 비효율적입니다. *여행 계획에 관련된 API*를 최대한 연결하는 것이 성능을 높이는데 도움을 줄 것 같습니다.
- 해외 여행에서는 특히 *사전 준비 목록*을 제공하는 것이 유용해 보입니다. 해당 도시나 국가에 적합한 *체크리스트*를 제공하게 하면 좋을 것 같습니다.
- 여행 중 이용할 *교통수단*에 대한 정보를 제공하는 에이전트를 추가하는 것이 필요해보입니다.
- 생성된 일정표의 신뢰성을 높이기 위해 *실제 장소 링크*를 포함시키는 것이 필요해 보입니다. 현재 구조에서 이를 구현할 방법을 고민해야 합니다.
- City Selection Expert, Local Expert, Amazing Travel Concierge가 반드시 협력해야 하는지 의문이 듭니다. 도시 후보, 도시에 대한 정보를 제공한 후 사용자가 직접 도시를 선택할 수 있도록 하는 것이 더 나을 것 같습니다.
- 설문 항목이 부족합니다. 동행 정보, 예산, 여행 기간 등을 다양하게 수용할 수 있도록 *설문 항목*을 수정해야 합니다.
- 모델에 따라 *적합한 프롬프트*, *적합한 파라미터*가 다릅니다. 기본 프롬프트만으로는 원하는 일정표를 얻는 것이 어렵기 때문에 똑똑한 모델을 사용할 것이 아니면 다양한 실험이 필요해보입니다.
